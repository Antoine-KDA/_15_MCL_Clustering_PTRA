I removed duplicated patients (comparators that later became cases) in the data management script
So now I need to recreate the descriptive table with the updated dataset

No change in the conclusions. 

Include the rhumatoid cvd into the resulsts pipeline: Table 1, 2, 3 + regression models. 
Avoid over adjustment in the cvd specific regression. 

Environnemental variables 
Build a model with year since the first ever cvd overall + stratification table + description table
In the runner file,  create environmental variables for running sensitivity analysis and move all output into a named folder with date. 
Move all tables to one Excel sheet.

Add descriptions to the figures and tables in the excel sheet. 

Use write table that provides a better outputs in the excel. 

Export the code list used and all important information: look back period, first cvd, etc...

Changes I made: 
- included the icd9 codes into the code lists.
